# Leap
You (and maybe a friend) are at the bottom of a very large mountainous region. After growing tired of your boring life, you have decided to climb to the top and search for a better one. Legends do speak of a mysterious machine and a Frog God… what could all of this mean? Could the Frog God be real? Does he have a paradise in the heavens? Is the mysterious machine a lie? The only way to find out is to make it to the top and find out what lies in store!

## Gameplay

You and your friend play as two frogs, named Flippy and Floppy respectively, and
together you climb to the top of a mountain.

You will explore multiple unique and breathtaking areas. These areas will range from grassy plains with a small mountain, a cliffside filled with mushrooms, an icy and barren land, and something else very special awaiting you in the skies.

### Single-player

You, as a lone frog, are climbing your way to the top of a very large mountainous region, with unique skills (easy mode only) to help you, enemies to avoid (normal mode only), and tough and potentially frustrating platforms to jump across all around.


### Multiplayer (Couch co-op)

Together, you and a friend must make it to the top of a very large mountainous region, with unique skills (easy mode only) to help you and your friend surpass tough platforming all around. It’s up to you and your friend to decide whether you are working together or competing!
